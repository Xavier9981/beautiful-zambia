Beautiful Zambia took time to visit Lilayi Lodge to gain first hand experience of this safari haven nestled in the capital of Zambia, Lusaka. 12 miles from Lusaka and say a 35 minute drive from Manda Hill shopping complex.\
The lodge is set in a private game reserve which home to a unique elephant orphanage which we believe is one of only three in the world.

For those that are foodies the culinary experience at Lilayi is one of kind. You experience Zambian hospitality at it's best the service is absolutely wonderful and nothing seems to much for the beautifully hospitable staff. The excellence in the restaurant is of very high international standards with service and attention to detail being the key factors. Our restaurant team take great pride in showing guests what we have to offer - I couldn't agree more wit "Dining in the heart of Lilayi Game Park means that guests have the opportunity to be surrounded by grazing wildlife as the sun sets in Zambia." What an enjoyable experience while enjoying very nice food with a whole lot of freshness running riot in ones taste buds.

Game Safari: That is something to look forward to with about 7 varieties of antelope, warthogs, zebra and giraffe. The tour driver was extremely knowledgeable and very pleasant with fantastic communication nothing seemed too much to ask. For the more adventurous the lodge offers horseback riding for experienced riders or walking safaris where one can get close to the animals. The walking safaris are always in the company of very experienced game guides.\
The highlight of all is the elephant orphanage where one can see the people interaction. Please note this is done only from a viewing point for guests.\
Now if you passing through, having a city break or just looking for a city getaway this is the place to be.
